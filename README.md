# NzFeral
A chrome extension which un-hides the premium content on the NZ Herald.

How do I add this to Chrome?

1) Download this repo if you haven't done so already.
2) Open chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3) Tick the "Developer mode" box at the top of the page.
4) Click "Load unpacked extension..." and select the NzFeral folder.

You should now see the NzFeral extension in the list of installed chrome extensions.

Thanks to Chloe for the name.
