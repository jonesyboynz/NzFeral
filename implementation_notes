Content is hidden by the "premium-content" class. Removing this class from the div where it is present will unhide the premium content.

Implemented in 4 lines of JS, without trying to minify it.

Content is hidden by a different class which seems to have a machine generated name such as "QUnWjUZnTonf".
In addition, this class is present on most of the child nodes of the article-content div.
I suspect that this name is dynamic. It could be ip-specific or it could change daily. Or not. Ill check tomorrow and on a different computer when I have a chance.
Anyway, you can determine which class is blocking the premium content by looking for the most frequent class in article-content's children. (It is present on nearly every node).
You then remove this class from the nodes that possess it.

Implemnted in 44 loc.

NZH updated their site. Looks like they have some fancy code which detects page mutations and redirects you to a subscription offer page if you are using an unblocker.term

Spent a few days mucking around with popups and message passing because I wanted to make the extension cooler. Parked that in a branch and went back to working on fixing the extension. Managed to trick the page mutation detection by appending a <p> to the document with all the blocking classes and styles, then removing the blockin classes and styles from all other elements.

Finally finished the UI work. There is now an autorun variable which can be toggled and a run button. Seems that the actual popup is broken again so I'm investigating that.

Fixed the issue with the blocker being detected. Just needed to add 10 dummy nodes rather than 1 lol.
