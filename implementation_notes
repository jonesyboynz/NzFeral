Content is hidden by the "premium-content" class. Removing this class from the div where it is present will unhide the premium content.

Implemented in 4 lines of JS, without trying to minify it.

Content is hidden by a different class which seems to have a machine generated name such as "QUnWjUZnTonf".
In addition, this class is present on most of the child nodes of the article-content div.
I suspect that this name is dynamic. It could be ip-specific or it could change daily. Or not. Ill check tomorrow and on a different computer when I have a chance.
Anyway, you can determine which class is blocking the premium content by looking for the most frequent class in article-content's children. (It is present on nearly every node).
You then remove this class from the nodes that possess it.
